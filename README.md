# Tic-Tac-Toe



This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe GUI made with Java Swing.

Players can mark squares on the 3 x 3 grid with **X's** and **O's** depending on the player's turn

At the end of the game, the winning side will be announced and a **"Play Again"**
button will appear, restarting the game when pressed.

I designed this project completely by myself.
